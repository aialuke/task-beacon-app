# Cursor Rules Audit Report

## Overview

This audit evaluates the current Cursor rules system for the Task Beacon React/TypeScript
application to optimize AI-assisted coding productivity and code quality. The evaluation focuses on
conciseness, modularity, clarity, redundancy reduction, and alignment with the modern tech stack
(React 19, TypeScript 5.5, Vite 5.4, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui).

**Audit Scope:**

- `.cursor/rules/` directory structure (15 active .mdc files)
- Legacy `.cursorrules` files
- Rule quality, organization, and tech stack compatibility

**Current State:**

- **Total Rules Size:** 919 lines (84% over 500-line target)
- **Structure:** Well-organized in core/, general/, tech-specific/ directories
- **Coverage:** Comprehensive for current tech stack
- **Critical Issue:** Significant redundancy and size overflow

## Findings

### üî¥ CRITICAL Issues (Immediate Action Required)

#### C1. Size Violation (Severity: Critical)

- **Problem:** 919 lines vs 500-line target (84% over limit)
- **Impact:** Excessive token usage affecting AI response quality and cost
- **Root Cause:** Significant content redundancy across multiple files

#### C2. Major Content Redundancy (Severity: Critical)

- **tailwind.mdc + uistyling.mdc:** 60-70% content overlap (149 lines total)
  - Duplicate sections: shadcn/ui integration, responsive design, performance optimization
- **code-style.mdc + codestylestructure.mdc:** Overlapping code organization patterns (127 lines
  total)
  - Duplicate sections: file organization, naming conventions, DRY principles
- **react-typescript.mdc + performance.mdc:** Overlapping React performance sections
  - Duplicate guidance: memoization, React.memo, lazy loading patterns

### üü° HIGH Priority Issues

#### H1. Poor Modularity (Severity: High)

- **react-typescript.mdc:** 101 lines covering 11 sections (too broad)
- **Performance guidance scattered:** Across 3 different files (react-typescript.mdc,
  performance.mdc, tailwind.mdc)

#### H2. File Organization Issues (Severity: High)

- **parraleltoolcalling.mdc:** Misplaced in root directory vs organized structure
- **Empty legacy file:** `.cursorrules` (0 lines) requires cleanup
