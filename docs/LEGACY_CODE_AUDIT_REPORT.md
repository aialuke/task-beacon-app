```

### 3. Duplicate/Redundant Functionality 🟡 **PHASE 3 - PENDING**

#### **Error Handling Duplication**
```
⚠️ src/lib/utils/error.ts (main file)
⚠️ src/lib/utils/error/index.ts (refactored version)
   - Issue: Two error handling systems coexist
   - Action: CONSOLIDATE - Keep refactored version, update imports

⚠️ src/lib/api/error-handling.ts
   - Issue: API-specific error handling separate from main system
   - Status: KEEP (domain-specific, but verify no duplication)
```

#### **Component Loading States**
```
✅ src/features/tasks/components/ImageLoadingState.tsx
✅ src/features/tasks/components/ImageErrorFallback.tsx
   - Issue: Specific loading components vs unified system
   - Action: EVALUATED - These provide specialized functionality, keeping as-is
   - Status: VERIFIED - No changes needed
```

### 4. Outdated Configuration & Build Files 🟢 **PHASE 4 - PENDING**

#### **Potentially Unused Dependencies**
```
❓ @testing-library/dom
   - Usage: May be implicitly used by @testing-library/react
   - Action: VERIFY if explicitly needed

❓ autoprefixer
   - Usage: PostCSS plugin, likely needed
   - Action: VERIFY postcss.config.js usage

❓ jsdom
   - Usage: Test environment for Vitest
   - Action: VERIFY if required for current test setup
```

#### **Legacy Import References**
```
⚠️ src/lib/utils/shared.ts
   - Issue: Large shared utility file
   - Action: VERIFY all exports are actually used

⚠️ src/lib/utils/index.ts
   - Issue: Barrel file that might have unused exports
   - Action: AUDIT which utilities are actually imported
```

### 5. Documentation & Asset Cleanup 🟢 **PHASE 4 - PENDING**

#### **Documentation Files**
```
✅ docs/CODEBASE_AUDIT_REPORT.md
✅ docs/CODEBASE_AUDIT_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md
   - Status: Both are comprehensive and valuable
   - Action: KEEP both (different purposes)

❓ public/assets/ folder
   - Issue: Multiple icon sizes and SVG files
   - Action: VERIFY all assets are referenced in code
```

## 📋 Migration Plan

### **✅ Phase 1: Safe File Removal** 🟢 **COMPLETED**
**Estimated Impact:** Reduce bundle size by 8-12%, improve build times

1. **✅ Remove unused loading components:**
   ```
   ✅ DELETED: src/components/ui/layout/LoadingSpinner.tsx
   ✅ DELETED: src/components/ui/layout/PageLoader.tsx
   ✅ DELETED: src/features/tasks/components/TaskLoadingStates.tsx
   ```

2. **✅ Remove redundant type wrappers:**
   ```
   ✅ DELETED: src/types/shared/common.types.ts
   ✅ DELETED: src/types/shared/api.types.ts
   ✅ UPDATE: All imports to use direct paths (verified none exist)
   ```

3. **✅ Remove outdated test files:**
   ```
   ✅ DELETED: src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskFormValidation.test.ts
   ✅ DELETED: src/features/users/hooks/*.test.ts (4 files)
   ```

### **✅ Phase 2: Import Pattern Updates** 🟢 **COMPLETED**
**Estimated Impact:** Improve consistency, reduce confusion

   ✅ VERIFIED: dataValidationUtils.ts and validationUtils.ts consistency
   ```

### **Phase 3: Error Handling Consolidation** 🟡 **PENDING**
**Estimated Impact:** Reduce code duplication, improve maintainability

1. **Unify error handling:**
   ```
   DECISION: Keep src/lib/utils/error/index.ts as primary
   UPDATE: src/lib/utils/error.ts to re-export from unified system
   VERIFY: No functionality is lost in transition
   ```

2. **Verify API error handling:**
   ```
   AUDIT: src/lib/api/error-handling.ts for duplication
   CONSOLIDATE: Any overlapping functionality
   ```

### **Phase 4: Final Cleanup** 🟢 **PENDING**
**Estimated Impact:** Clean repository, reduce maintenance burden

1. **Audit and clean utility exports:**
   ```
   VERIFY: src/lib/utils/shared.ts exports are used
   VERIFY: src/lib/utils/index.ts exports are used
   REMOVE: Any unused utility functions
   ```

2. **Dependency cleanup:**
   ```
   VERIFY: @testing-library/dom usage
   VERIFY: autoprefixer necessity
   VERIFY: jsdom requirement
   ```

3. **Asset verification:**
   ```
   AUDIT: public/assets/ folder usage
   REMOVE: Any unreferenced assets
   ```
