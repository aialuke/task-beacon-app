#### 4. 🚨 **EXPANDED CRITICAL ISSUE**: Widespread State Management & Performance Over-Engineering

**🔍 Comprehensive Audit Findings**:

**A. Build-Breaking Import Errors** (Immediate Priority):
1. `src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskForm.ts` - imports deleted `useUnifiedFormState`
2. `src/hooks/ui/index.ts` - incorrect default exports for motion/navbar/viewport hooks

**B. Performance Hook Overuse** (8+ files affected):
1. **`src/components/form/hooks/useTaskPhotoUpload.ts`**:
   - `useOptimizedMemo` for simple processing options object
   - `useOptimizedCallback` for basic async functions
   - Should use standard `useMemo`/`useCallback`

2. **Task Mutation Hooks** (4 files):
   - `src/features/tasks/hooks/mutations/useTaskDeletion.ts`
   - `src/features/tasks/hooks/mutations/useTaskUpdates.ts`
   - `src/features/tasks/hooks/mutations/useTaskCreation.ts`
   - `src/features/tasks/hooks/mutations/useTaskStatus.ts`
   - All use `useOptimizedCallback` for simple wrapper functions
   - Should use standard `useCallback`

3. **`src/features/tasks/components/cards/OptimizedTaskCard.tsx`**:
   - Uses `useMemoizedCallback`, `useMemoizedComputation`, `memoizeComponent`
   - Over-engineered for simple task card component
   - Should use standard `memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`

**C. Form State Management Issues**:
1. **`src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskForm.ts`**:
   - References deleted `useUnifiedFormState`
   - Needs complete rewrite using standard React hooks
   - Should use `useState`, `useCallback` for form management

**D. UI Hook Export Mismatches**:
1. **`src/hooks/ui/motion.ts`, `navbar.ts`, `viewport.ts`**:
   - Export named functions but index expects default exports
   - Causing build errors

## 📋 REVISED & EXPANDED Reorganization Plan
