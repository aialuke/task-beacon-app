**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
**Completion Date**: 2024-12-08

**Achievements**:
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate context implementations (`TaskDataContext` vs `TaskDataContextOptimized`)
- ✅ Created unified state management system with `useUnifiedState`, `useUnifiedAsyncState`, and `useUnifiedCollection`
- ✅ Implemented standardized context factory pattern with `createUnifiedContext`
