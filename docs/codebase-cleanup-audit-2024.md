- **Optimistic Updates**: `useOptimisticAsyncOperation` with rollback capability for better UX
- **Factory Pattern**: `createAsyncOperationFactory` for creating consistent async operation hooks
- **Pre-configured Factories**: API, UI, and critical operation factories with appropriate defaults

**Performance Benefits**:
- âœ… Standardized error handling reduces code duplication and improves debugging
- âœ… Batch operations provide controlled concurrency for better performance
- âœ… Optimistic updates improve perceived performance with rollback safety

- âœ… Built enhanced lazy loading system with retry logic in `src/lib/utils/lazy-loading.ts`
- âœ… Consolidated component patterns using existing utilities instead of creating conflicting files

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Component Patterns**: Used existing memoization utilities and enhanced them
- **Query Optimization**: Type-based query configurations (content, metadata, real-time, static) with appropriate caching strategies
- **Context Management**: Leveraged existing modal management context patterns
- **Lazy Loading**: Enhanced lazy component factory with retry logic, timeout handling, and performance metrics
- **Performance Tracking**: Built-in component load time tracking and metrics collection

**Performance Benefits**:

**Files Enhanced**: Leveraged 4 existing utility files instead of creating new conflicting ones

#### âœ… Step 2.3: COMPLETED - Standardize Hook Patterns
**Status**: COMPLETED âœ…
**Completion Date**: 2024-12-08

**Achievements**:
- âœ… Standardized task mutation hooks by removing complex orchestrator patterns
- âœ… Split large photo upload hook into focused, single-responsibility hooks
- âœ… Simplified useTaskMutations to directly use focused mutation hooks
- âœ… Created modular photo state management with `usePhotoState` and `usePhotoProcessing`
- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility with legacy hook interfaces
- âœ… Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and test failures

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Task Mutations**: Simplified `useTaskMutations` to directly expose focused hooks without orchestrator complexity
- **Photo Upload Hooks**: Split into three focused hooks:
  - `usePhotoState`: Core photo state management
  - `usePhotoProcessing`: Photo file processing logic
  - `useTaskPhotoUpload`: Task-specific photo upload integration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Added compatibility functions for removed hooks (`useTaskStatusMutations`, `useTaskDeleteMutations`)
- **Test Updates**: Updated test files to work with new hook structure and removed dependencies on deleted files
- **Interface Consistency**: Ensured all photo upload methods are properly exposed for existing components

**Performance Benefits**:
- âœ… Reduced hook complexity through focused, single-responsibility patterns
- âœ… Improved tree shaking with modular hook structure
- âœ… Better debugging experience with clear hook separation
- âœ… Enhanced maintainability with standardized hook patterns
- âœ… Eliminated duplicate code in photo upload functionality

**Files Modified**: 8 files updated, 3 files created, 3 files deleted
