#### **Critical Finding**: Extensive Additional Over-Engineering Discovered

**🚨 Post-Phase 2.4.6.1 Comprehensive Audit Results:**

**A. Empty/Minimal Directories** 🔴 **REQUIRES CLEANUP**:
1. ⚠️ `src/hooks/performance/` - Now empty after hook deletion, directory should be removed
2. ⚠️ `src/hooks/unified/` - Contains only empty index files, serves no purpose
3. ⚠️ Main `src/hooks/index.ts` - Still exports these empty directories

**B. Query Hook Abstractions** 🔴 **UNNECESSARY WRAPPERS**:
1. ⚠️ `src/hooks/queries/useOptimizedQueries.ts` - Unnecessary wrapper around standard React Query
2. ⚠️ `src/hooks/queries/useStandardizedLoading.ts` - Duplicates React Query built-in functionality
3. ⚠️ `src/hooks/queries/useEnhancedErrorHandling.ts` - Over-complicated error handling patterns
4. ⚠️ `src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskQueryOptimized.ts` - Duplicate of standard `useTaskQuery`
5. ⚠️ `src/features/tasks/hooks/useTasksQueryOptimized.ts` - Duplicate of standard `useTasksQuery`

**C. Over-Engineered Component Abstractions** 🔴 **UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY**:

   - `TaskListCore.tsx`, `TaskListFilters.tsx`, `TaskListPagination.tsx`
   - `TaskRenderCallbacks.tsx`, `EnhancedTaskRenderCallbacks.tsx`
   - All provide minimal abstraction over standard React patterns
2. ⚠️ `src/components/ui/loading/UnifiedLoadingStates.tsx` - Over-engineered loading patterns
3. ⚠️ `src/components/ui/error/UnifiedErrorHandler.tsx` - Overcomplicated error display logic

**D. Task Form Hook Layering** 🔴 **EXCESSIVE ABSTRACTION**:
1. ⚠️ Multiple layers of form hooks with unclear separation of concerns
2. ⚠️ `useTaskFormBase`, `useTaskForm`, `useCreateTask` - Overlapping responsibilities
3. ⚠️ Potential for consolidation without functionality loss

**E. Documentation Conflicts** 🔴 **REQUIRES RESOLUTION**:
1. ⚠️ `docs/performance-guidelines.md` conflicts with new comprehensive system
2. ⚠️ Multiple sources of truth for performance guidance
