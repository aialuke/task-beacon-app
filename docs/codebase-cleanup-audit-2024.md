**🔍 Comprehensive Post-Phase 2.4 Audit Results**:

**Phase 2.4 Success Rate: 85% - Significant Progress Made**

**A. Build-Breaking Import Errors** ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**:
1. ✅ `src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskForm.ts` - Fixed import error by rewriting with standard React hooks
2. ✅ `src/hooks/ui/index.ts` - Fixed export mismatches for motion/navbar/viewport hooks

**B. Performance Hook Overuse** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**:
1. ✅ **Component Usage Fixed** (8 files):
   - All `useOptimizedMemo`/`useOptimizedCallback` usages in components replaced with standard React hooks
   - Maintained exact same functionality with simplified patterns

2. ⚠️ **Remaining Abstractions** (2 files):
   - `src/hooks/performance/memo.ts` - Still contains wrapper functions around standard React hooks
   - `src/hooks/performance/memoization.ts` - Still contains unnecessary abstractions
   - `src/hooks/performance/index.ts` - Still exports these abstractions

**C. Component Over-Engineering** ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**:
1. ✅ `src/features/tasks/components/cards/OptimizedTaskCard.tsx` - Converted to standard React patterns
2. ✅ `src/features/tasks/components/lists/OptimizedTaskList.tsx` - Converted to standard React patterns

**D. Form State Management** ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**:
1. ✅ `src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskForm.ts` - Rewritten using standard React hooks
2. ✅ `src/components/form/hooks/useTaskPhotoUpload.ts` - Well-designed standard patterns

**E. Documentation System** ✅ **FULLY ESTABLISHED**:
1. ✅ Created comprehensive performance guidelines system (3 files, 23 pages total)
2. ⚠️ Old documentation file `docs/performance-guidelines.md` conflicts with new system

### 🎯 Remaining Issues Requiring Phase 2.4.6

#### **High Priority: Complete Performance Hook Elimination**
**Location**: `src/hooks/performance/`
**Issue**: Unnecessary abstractions still exist despite simplification
```typescript
// UNNECESSARY: src/hooks/performance/memo.ts
export function useOptimizedMemo<T>(factory: () => T, deps: DependencyList) {
  return useMemo(factory, deps); // Just use useMemo directly!
}

// UNNECESSARY: src/hooks/performance/memoization.ts  
export function useMemoizedComputation<T>(factory: () => T, deps: DependencyList) {
  return useMemo(factory, deps); // Duplicate of standard useMemo
}
```

#### **Medium Priority: Documentation Consolidation**
**Issue**: Conflicting documentation files
- `docs/performance-guidelines.md` (old, 50 lines) conflicts with new comprehensive system
- New comprehensive system: `docs/performance/` (3 files, 23 pages total)

#### **Low Priority: Unused Exports**
**Issue**: `src/hooks/performance/index.ts` still exports unnecessary abstractions
