# Performance Optimization Guide

## Bundle Size Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- All pages are lazy-loaded using React.lazy()
- Components are split into feature-based modules
- Third-party libraries are imported only when needed

### Tree Shaking
- Using ES modules for all imports/exports
- Removed unused utility functions and components
- Optimized Tailwind CSS to include only used classes

### Image Optimization
- Images are compressed and resized automatically
- WebP format support for modern browsers
- Lazy loading implemented for images

## Real-time Performance

### Subscription Management
- Proper cleanup of Supabase channels to prevent memory leaks
- Debounced real-time updates to avoid excessive re-renders
- Optimized query invalidation strategy

### Query Optimization
- React Query with appropriate stale times
- Intelligent caching strategy
- Background refetching for better UX

## Best Practices Implemented

### React Performance
- Memoization with React.memo for stable components
- useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect

### CSS Performance
- Minimal CSS imports
- Optimized Tailwind configuration
- Reduced custom CSS in favor of utility classes

### JavaScript Performance
- Debounced search inputs
- Throttled scroll handlers
- Virtualized lists for large datasets

## Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Real-time subscription health monitoring
- Query performance monitoring with React Query DevTools

### Error Tracking
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Real-time error reporting
- Performance degradation alerts
