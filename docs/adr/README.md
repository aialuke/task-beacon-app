# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Task Management Application. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, alternatives considered, and consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records are short text documents that capture an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. They help track the evolution of the architecture and provide valuable context for future decisions.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-YYYY]]

## Context
[Description of the problem and context that led to this decision]

## Decision
[The specific decision that was made]

## Alternatives Considered
[List of alternative solutions that were considered]

## Consequences
[Positive and negative consequences of this decision]

## Implementation
[How the decision will be implemented]

## Notes
[Any additional notes or references]
```
