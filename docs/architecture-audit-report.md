- **Enhanced `src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskQueryOptimized.ts`**: Optimized single task queries with improved error handling
- **Updated Query Configuration**: Implemented different query types (realtime, stable, content) with appropriate caching strategies

#### Key Improvements:
- Smart retry logic that considers error types
- Exponential backoff for retry delays
- Intelligent prefetching of next pages
- Query type-based caching strategies
- Enhanced query key structures
- Network mode optimization (offlineFirst for stable data)

#### Performance Gains:
- **Reduced Network Requests**: Intelligent prefetching and caching
- **Faster Navigation**: Prefetched data for pagination
- **Better Offline Support**: Network-aware query configurations
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Optimized query patterns eliminate duplicate logic

### 3.2: Standardize Loading States ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

#### Changes Made:
- **Created `src/hooks/queries/useStandardizedLoading.ts`**: Unified loading state management across all components
- **Implemented Loading Variants**: Different loading patterns for various UI contexts (page, card, background, action)
- **Enhanced Loading State Interface**: Comprehensive loading state with granular properties

#### Key Improvements:
- Consistent loading state interface across all components
- Context-aware loading variants (page vs card vs background loading)
- Smart empty state detection
- Granular loading state properties (isInitialLoading, isRefetching, etc.)
- Backward compatibility with existing loading patterns

#### Developer Experience:
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Standardized loading state creation
- **Consistent UX**: Uniform loading behaviors across the app
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript interfaces for all loading states
- **Easy Testing**: Predictable loading state structures

### 3.3: Enhance Error Handling ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

#### Changes Made:
- **Created `src/hooks/queries/useEnhancedErrorHandling.ts`**: Comprehensive error classification and recovery system
