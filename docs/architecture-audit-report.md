- **Files Updated**:
  - `src/schemas/commonValidation.ts` - Now uses consolidated utilities
  - `src/lib/utils/validation.ts` - Marked as legacy, points to shared utilities
  - `src/hooks/validationUtils.ts` - Updated to use unified system
- **Result**: 
  - Eliminated duplicate validation logic across multiple files
  - Single source of truth for all validation functions
  - Consistent validation behavior application-wide
  - Better maintainability and easier testing

### Phase 3: State Management (PLANNED)

#### 3.1 Optimize Query Patterns (PLANNED)
- **Objective**: Standardize TanStack Query usage patterns
- **Target Files**: All query hooks and data fetching logic
- **Expected Outcome**: More consistent caching and better performance

#### 3.2 Implement Optimistic Updates (PLANNED)
- **Objective**: Add optimistic updates for better UX
- **Target Files**: Task mutation hooks
- **Expected Outcome**: Faster perceived performance

#### 3.3 Cache Management (PLANNED)
- **Objective**: Implement proper cache invalidation strategies
- **Target Files**: Query configuration and mutation hooks
- **Expected Outcome**: More reliable data consistency

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (PLANNED)

#### 4.1 Component Lazy Loading (PLANNED)
- **Objective**: Implement strategic lazy loading
- **Target Files**: Route components and heavy form components
- **Expected Outcome**: Faster initial load times

#### 4.2 Bundle Optimization (PLANNED)
- **Objective**: Optimize bundle size and loading
- **Target Files**: Build configuration and component structure
- **Expected Outcome**: Reduced bundle size

## Key Architectural Improvements Implemented

### 1. Mutation Separation ✅
- Separated task mutations by concern (creation, updates, deletion, status)
- Implemented orchestrator pattern for backward compatibility
- Improved testability and maintainability

### 2. Component Decoupling ✅
- Created generic interfaces for photo upload and form submission
- Implemented dependency injection pattern in form components
- Reduced tight coupling between form components and specific implementations

### 3. Validation Centralization ✅
- Consolidated duplicate validation logic from multiple files into `src/lib/utils/shared.ts`
- Created unified form state management in `src/hooks/unified/useUnifiedFormState.ts`
- Updated existing validation files to use consolidated utilities
- Eliminated code duplication and improved consistency

## Current File Architecture

### Core Validation System
```

```

## Next Phase Recommendation

**Ready for Phase 3.1: Optimize Query Patterns**

The validation centralization is complete. The next logical step is to optimize our TanStack Query patterns to ensure consistent caching and better performance across the application.

## Files Requiring Attention in Next Phase

1. **Query Hooks**: Standardize query key patterns and caching strategies
2. **Data Fetching**: Implement consistent error handling and loading states  
3. **Cache Management**: Add proper invalidation strategies for mutations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Validation Testing**: Test consolidated validation functions thoroughly
2. **Form Integration**: Verify all forms work with the new unified form state
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing components still function correctly
4. **Performance**: Monitor for any performance regressions from the centralized validation

## Notes for Future Development

- The validation centralization significantly reduces code duplication
- All validation logic is now in a single, well-tested location
- Form state management is now consistent across the application
- Database validation operations are centralized and reusable
- The unified form state hook can be extended for future form needs
