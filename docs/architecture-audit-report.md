## 🔴 Critical Architectural Issues

### 1. Misplaced UI Logic in Lib Directory
**Severity:** ⚠️ High  
**Files:** `src/lib/badge-variants.ts`, `src/lib/button-variants.ts`

**Problem:**
UI component variant definitions are stored in the `lib` directory instead of with their respective components.

**Impact:**
- ❌ Breaks single responsibility principle
- ❌ Creates confusion about where UI logic belongs  
- ❌ Makes component variants harder to find and maintain
- ❌ Violates co-location best practices

**Current Structure:**
```
src/lib/
├── badge-variants.ts    ❌ Should be with Badge component
└── button-variants.ts   ❌ Should be with Button component
```

**Recommended Structure:**
```
src/components/ui/
├── badge/
│   ├── Badge.tsx
│   └── variants.ts      ✅ Co-located with component
└── button/
    ├── Button.tsx
    └── variants.ts      ✅ Co-located with component
```

---

### 2. Scattered Type System with Massive Index Files
**Severity:** ⚠️ High  
**Files:** `src/types/index.ts` (223 lines), `src/types/pagination.types.ts` (240 lines)

**Problems:**
- Main types index file is a 223-line monolith mixing concerns
- Pagination types file contains both types AND implementation logic
- Type imports scattered across different patterns
- Poor tree-shaking potential due to barrel exports

**Impact:**
- ❌ Difficult to understand type relationships
- ❌ Circular dependency risks
- ❌ Poor bundle optimization
- ❌ Mixed responsibilities (types + logic)

**Current Issues:**
```typescript
// src/types/pagination.types.ts - MIXED CONCERNS
export interface PaginationMeta { ... }     // ✅ Types
export function calculatePaginationMeta(...) // ❌ Implementation logic
export function validatePaginationParams(...) // ❌ Implementation logic
```

---

### 3. Feature-Specific Hooks in Global Hooks Directory
**Severity:** ⚠️ High  
**Files:** `src/hooks/useProfileValidation.ts`, `src/hooks/usePagination.ts`

**Problem:**
Feature-specific validation and business logic hooks are mixed with core/generic hooks.

**Impact:**
- ❌ Violates feature cohesion principles
- ❌ Makes feature boundaries unclear
- ❌ Harder to maintain feature independence
- ❌ Confusing for developers working on specific features

**Current Structure:**
```
src/hooks/
├── useProfileValidation.ts  ❌ User feature specific
├── usePagination.ts         ❓ Could be generic
└── useMotionPreferences.ts  ✅ Truly generic
```

**Recommended Structure:**
```
src/features/users/hooks/
└── useProfileValidation.ts  ✅ Feature co-located

src/lib/hooks/
└── usePagination.ts         ✅ If truly generic
```

---

## 🟡 Moderate Architectural Issues

### 4. Complex Utility Organization with Deep Nesting
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium  
**Files:** `src/lib/utils/` hierarchy

**Problems:**
- Over-engineered utility structure (6+ levels deep in some areas)
- Utility functions scattered across multiple files with unclear boundaries
- Lazy loading patterns for utilities that may not need it
- Complex import paths

**Current Deep Nesting Example:**
```
src/lib/utils/
├── image/
│   ├── convenience/
│   │   ├── advanced.ts
│   │   └── basic.ts
│   ├── processing/
│   │   └── core.ts
│   ├── validation/
│   │   └── batch.ts
│   └── resource-management/
│       └── preview.ts
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Developer confusion about where to find/add utilities
- ❌ Import path complexity
- ❌ Potential performance overhead from unnecessary lazy loading

---

### 5. Mixed Concerns in Components Directory
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium  
**Files:** `src/features/tasks/components/`

**Problems:**
- Timer components mixed with general task components
- Dashboard header in task features (should be in layout)
- Components that could be reusable stored in feature-specific folders

**Current Structure Issues:**
```
src/features/tasks/components/
├── TaskDashboardHeader.tsx     ❌ Should be in layout
├── CountdownTimer.tsx          ❌ Should be in ui/timer
├── timer/
│   ├── TimerDisplay.tsx        ✅ Good organization
│   └── TimerRing.tsx           ✅ Good organization
└── cards/                      ✅ Good organization
```

---

### 6. Validation Schema Organization
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium  
**Files:** `src/schemas/` vs `src/lib/validation/`

**Problems:**
- Validation logic split between `schemas` and `lib/validation`
- Duplicate validation patterns
- Inconsistent import paths for validation

**Current Split:**
```
src/schemas/           ❓ Zod schemas
src/lib/validation/    ❓ Validation utilities
```

---

## 🟢 Minor Issues & Optimizations

### 7. Excessive Index File Usage
**Severity:** 🟢 Low  
**Count:** 19 index.ts files

**Issues:**
- Too many barrel exports potentially hurting bundle size
- Some index files may be unnecessary
- Complex re-export chains

### 8. Large Hook Files
**Severity:** 🟢 Low  
**Files:** `useUnifiedForm.ts` (287 lines)

**Issues:**
- Some hooks are becoming monolithic
- Multiple responsibilities in single hooks
- Could benefit from composition patterns
