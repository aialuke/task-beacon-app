# API Architecture Audit Report - January 2025

## Executive Summary

This audit examines the current API layer architecture focusing on duplicate logic, code redundancy, file organization, state management, and unnecessary complexity. The codebase shows a sophisticated but sometimes over-engineered approach with several areas for consolidation.

## Progress Update

### ✅ COMPLETED - Step 1: Consolidate Error Handling
**Status**: COMPLETE - Duplicate error handling consolidated into single source of truth

- ✅ Static class pattern replaced with simple functions

**New Implementation:**
```
createTask() → supabase call with error handling
updateTask() → supabase call with error handling
getTasks() → supabase call with error handling
```

**Impact:** ✅ HIGH IMPROVEMENT - Cognitive overhead eliminated, debugging simplified

#### ~~2.2 Complex Pagination Abstractions~~ (Minor remaining complexity)
**Files Affected:**
- `src/features/tasks/hooks/useTasksQuery.ts`
- `src/features/tasks/context/TaskDataContext.tsx`
- `src/hooks/usePagination.ts` (referenced but not in current files)

**Issues:**
- Multiple layers of pagination state management
- Prop drilling of pagination objects
- Complex interfaces for simple pagination needs

**Impact:** Medium - Harder to maintain, debug pagination issues
