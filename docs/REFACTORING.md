# Refactoring Process Documentation

This document outlines the multi-phase refactoring process undertaken to improve the codebase architecture, organization, and maintainability.

## Phase 1: Foundation Fixes

### Standardized CSS Variable Naming
- Updated variable naming conventions to be consistent (`--radius-*` instead of `--border-radius-*`)
- Created standard status color variables (`--status-*` instead of `--timer-*`)

### Consolidated Utility Functions
- Combined related utilities into logical groups
- Created specialized utility modules for animation, dates, and UI helpers

### Fixed Context Separation
- Separated `TaskContext` into `TaskDataContext` and `TaskUIContext` 
- Improved separation of concerns for data fetching vs UI state management

## Phase 2: Code Organization

### CSS File Structure
- Split large CSS files into focused component and utility files
- Organized imports with clear naming conventions
- Created dedicated files for specific component types (e.g., `timer.css`, `buttons.css`)

### Type Definitions
- Created separate type modules for API and UI concerns
- Added comprehensive documentation to type definitions
- Established consistent naming patterns for interface props

### Error Handling
- Implemented standardized error handling approaches
- Added toast notifications for user feedback
- Created reusable error utility functions

## Phase 3: Component Improvements

### Component Breakdown
- Extracted `CountdownTimer` logic into a custom `useCountdown` hook
- Refactored `TaskCard` to use a dedicated `useTaskCard` hook
- Created smaller, focused components with single responsibilities

### Hook Composition
- Consolidated task mutation hooks into a unified `useTaskMutation` hook
- Implemented consistent patterns for hook creation and usage
- Added proper memoization for performance optimization

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to components and hooks
- Created detailed prop interface documentation
- Added this REFACTORING.md document to explain the process

## Benefits of Refactoring

### Maintainability
- Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and maintain
- Consistent naming conventions improve developer experience
- Better separation of concerns makes code more predictable

### Performance
- Proper memoization reduces unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized component structures improve initial load time
- More efficient CSS organization reduces stylesheet size

### Extensibility
- Well-defined component interfaces make extensions easier
- Hook composition patterns allow for flexible feature additions
- Clear documentation helps new developers understand the system

## Future Improvements

- Further extraction of complex components into smaller pieces
- Enhanced accessibility features throughout the application
- Additional performance optimizations for list rendering
- Comprehensive unit test coverage for components and hooks
