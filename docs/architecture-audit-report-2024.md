### Bundle Architecture Improvements

**Lazy Loading Strategy**:
- **Core Components**: Load immediately for essential functionality
- **Heavy Features**: Load on-demand (image processing, virtualization, complex forms)
- **Utility Functions**: Dynamic imports with fallback mechanisms
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and fallback states

**Performance Optimizations**:
- **Tree Shaking**: Optimized exports and imports for better dead code elimination
- **Code Splitting**: Feature-based bundles reduce initial load
- **Caching**: Improved component preloading and caching strategies
- **Adaptive Loading**: Connection-aware loading decisions

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Validation System Architecture
- **Central Hub**: `src/schemas/index.ts` exports all validation schemas
- **Integration Points**: Hooks, forms, and API layers use centralized validation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with Zod schemas
- **Performance**: Optimized validation with caching and memoization
- **Bundle Optimization**: Fixed dynamic imports for better tree shaking

### Type System Organization  
- **Core Types**: `src/types/index.ts` as main entry point
- **Feature Types**: Domain-specific types in `src/types/feature-types/`
- **Utility Types**: Helper types in `src/types/utility.types.ts`
- **API Types**: Backend integration types in `src/types/api.types.ts`

### Lazy Loading Infrastructure
- **Component Factory**: `src/lib/utils/lazy-loading.ts` provides utilities for creating lazy components
- **Error Resilience**: Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Performance Tracking**: Built-in metrics for load time monitoring
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Connection quality-aware loading decisions

### Code Quality Metrics
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enabled across entire codebase with all errors resolved
- **ESLint Compliance**: All files pass linting rules
- **Import Organization**: Standardized import ordering and grouping
