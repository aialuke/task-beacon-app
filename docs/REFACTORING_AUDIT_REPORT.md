- Utility function splits (items 1, 5, 8)

### Medium Risk Refactoring
- Service layer changes (item 7)
- Component refactoring (item 4)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Maintain public APIs** - Keep existing import paths working during transition
2. **Incremental migration** - Refactor one module at a time
3. **Comprehensive testing** - Ensure all existing tests pass after refactoring
4. **Backward compatibility** - Use index.ts files to maintain existing imports

- **Import specificity** improvement (importing only needed types/functions)
- **Build time** improvements
- **Bundle size** optimizations

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Developer satisfaction** with code organization
- **Time to find** specific functions/types
- **Ease of testing** individual components
- **Code review efficiency**

## Conclusion

This refactoring initiative will significantly improve the codebase's maintainability, testability, and developer experience. The phased approach ensures minimal disruption while delivering continuous improvements. Focus should be placed on the highest priority items first, as they have the most significant impact on daily development workflow.

The investment in refactoring these 13 files will pay dividends in reduced debugging time, faster feature development, and improved code quality across the entire application.
