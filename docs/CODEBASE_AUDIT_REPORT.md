- Good use of barrel exports (`index.ts` files)

### 2. **Strong TypeScript Implementation**
- Comprehensive type definitions in `src/types/`
- Good use of interfaces and utility types
- Proper generic constraints and type safety

### 3. **Consistent API Layer Architecture**
- Clean service abstraction in `src/lib/api/`
- Standardized error handling patterns
- Good separation between Supabase and application logic

### 4. **Modern React Patterns**
- Proper use of custom hooks
- Context API for state management
- React Query for server state

## ‚úÖ All Phases Completed Successfully

### Phase 1: Component Refactoring ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **Completed Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Split `TaskDetails.tsx` into focused sub-components:
  - `TaskDetailsContent.tsx` - Content display logic
  - `TaskImageGallery.tsx` - Image gallery with preview
- ‚úÖ Refactored `ImagePreviewModal.tsx` with extracted components:
  - `ImageLoadingState.tsx` - Loading state display
  - `ImageErrorFallback.tsx` - Error state handling
  - `useImagePreview.ts` - Custom hook for preview logic
- ‚úÖ Achieved target of <50 lines per component
- ‚úÖ Improved separation of concerns

### Phase 2: Hook Optimization ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **Completed Hook Refactoring:**
- ‚úÖ Created focused hooks from complex ones:
  - `useTaskOptimisticUpdates.ts` - Optimistic update logic
  - `useTaskStatusMutations.ts` - Status-specific mutations
  - `useTaskSubmission.ts` - Form submission handling
  - `useTaskFormState.ts` - Form state management
  - `useTaskWorkflowStatus.ts` - Workflow status tracking
- ‚úÖ Simplified `useTaskWorkflow.ts` by extracting concerns
- ‚úÖ Refactored `useTaskFormOrchestration.ts` for better separation
- ‚úÖ Updated dependent hooks to use new architecture
- ‚úÖ Achieved target of <75 lines per hook

### Phase 3: Architecture Cleanup ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **Completed Standardization:**
- ‚úÖ Standardized import patterns across all modified files:
  - External libraries ‚Üí Internal utilities ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Hooks ‚Üí Types
  - Consistent comment structure for organization
- ‚úÖ Optimized context usage in `TaskProviders.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling consistency in validation modules
- ‚úÖ Consolidated API layer with `standardized-api.ts`
- ‚úÖ Enhanced provider composition and exports

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **Comprehensive Testing Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Added component tests for refactored components:
  - `TaskImageGallery.test.tsx` - Gallery component testing
  - `TaskDetailsContent.test.tsx` - Content display testing
- ‚úÖ Added hook tests for refactored utilities:
  - `useTaskOptimisticUpdates.test.ts` - Optimistic update testing
  - `useTaskStatusMutations.test.ts` - Status mutation testing
- ‚úÖ Updated integration tests:
  - Enhanced `taskWorkflow.integration.test.tsx` for new hook structure
  - Added comprehensive error handling tests
  - Improved test coverage for workflow scenarios
- ‚úÖ Enhanced component documentation with comprehensive JSDoc
- ‚úÖ Applied testing best practices and patterns

## üìä Final Metrics and Achievements

### **Code Quality Metrics - All Targets Exceeded**
