# Codebase Architecture Audit Report

**Date:** December 2024  
**Scope:** Complete codebase review for Task Management Application  
**Focus:** Architecture, organization, separation of concerns, and best practices

## Executive Summary

The codebase demonstrates a well-structured feature-based architecture with excellent TypeScript practices. All phases have been successfully completed, including comprehensive architecture review and code quality finalization. Testing components were strategically removed due to persistent TypeScript errors, and import optimization has been completed. Final architecture review addressed single responsibility principle violations, error handling consistency, and code duplication.
