/**
 * Task API Types
 * 
 * DEPRECATED: This file previously re-exported from @/types/api.types
 * 
 * All API types are now properly organized and available through:
 * - @/types - Main type system exports
 * - @/types/shared/api.types - Core API response patterns
 * - @/types/feature-types/task.types - Task-specific types
 * 
 * Use the main @/types export for all API-related types:
 * import type { ApiResponse, ApiError, Task, TaskStatus } from '@/types';
 */

// Re-export API types from centralized location
// Note: @/types/api.types has been deprecated and removed
// All API types are now available through @/types
