# Task Beacon App - Comprehensive Codebase Architecture Audit

## Background and Motivation

The Task Beacon application is a React 19 + TypeScript application with Supabase backend, built
using modern development practices. This comprehensive audit aims to:

1. **Ensure Clean Architecture**: Verify that the codebase follows established React/TypeScript
   architectural patterns
2. **Optimize Modularity**: Identify opportunities for better separation of concerns and code
   organization
3. **Improve Maintainability**: Find areas where code could be better structured for long-term
   maintenance
4. **Enhance Performance**: Identify performance anti-patterns and optimization opportunities

**Current Architectural Context:**

- Feature-based directory structure (auth, dashboard, profile, tasks, users)
- Shared components and services architecture
- Multiple layers: components, hooks, services, types, utils
- Comprehensive testing structure with **tests** directories
- Modern React patterns with hooks and functional components

**Key Concern Identified:** The project structure shows both a root `src/` directory and a
`task-beacon-app/src/` directory, suggesting potential duplication or unclear organization.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Primary Architectural Concerns

1. **Directory Structure Duplication**

   - Dual `src/` directories may indicate unclear project organization
   - Potential for code duplication or inconsistent patterns
   - Risk of developer confusion about where to place new code

2. **Component Architecture Complexity**

   - Need to verify proper separation of UI from business logic
   - Ensure components follow single responsibility principle
   - Validate proper composition patterns vs inheritance

3. **Cross-Feature Dependencies**

   - Risk of tight coupling between features (auth, dashboard, tasks, etc.)
   - Need to verify proper abstraction boundaries
   - Potential for circular dependencies

4. **State Management Patterns**

   - Multiple state management approaches (TanStack Query, React Context)
   - Need to ensure consistent patterns across features
   - Verify proper data flow and state ownership

5. **Code Organization Scalability**
   - As the application grows, current structure must remain maintainable
   - Shared utilities and services need proper organization
   - Testing architecture must align with code structure

### Success Criteria for Resolution

- **Clean Directory Structure**: Single, consistent organization pattern
- **Clear Feature Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between modules
- **Proper Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data layers clearly separated
- **Optimal Performance**: No architectural bottlenecks or anti-patterns
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
